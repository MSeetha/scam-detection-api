Michael had been running his handcrafted furniture business for over a decade. His craftsmanship was exceptional, and word-of-mouth kept him busy enough.
Until it didn't.
"I lost a Kshs 100,000 contract because the client couldn't 'verify my legitimacy' online," Michael told us. "They wanted to see my portfolio website and contact me through a professional email. My personal Gmail and Facebook page weren't enough."
This wake-up call led Michael to Aurae Software Labs, where we helped him establish his complete digital identity:

‚úÖ A professional domain name (MichaelsCustomFurniture.com)
‚úÖ Business email (michael@michaelscustomfurniture.com)
‚úÖ A stunning, SEO-optimized website showcasing his work

The results? Within just 3 months:

His website appeared on the first page of Google for "custom furniture in Nairobi"
Inquiries increased by 215%
He secured two major commercial contracts who found him online

"I didn't realize how many customers I was losing by being invisible online," Michael shared. "Now clients tell me how professional my business appears before they even meet me."
