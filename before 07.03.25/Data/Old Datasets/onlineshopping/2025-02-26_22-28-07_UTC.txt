Cade with a beautiful Upper Yakima Bow! Fishing has been great, and the upper river is still in good shape. Check our bio for the most recent fishing report. 

Cade will be helping out at the Skwala Tying class this Saturday. There is very limited availability, so get in on it while you can! The link is in our bio as well.
