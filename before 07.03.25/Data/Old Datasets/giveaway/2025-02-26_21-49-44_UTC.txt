#LightsOnLefloss does it again in 2024!  Got my yard sign and $100 Lowe’s gift card delivered today. I’ve decided to give away the gift card to a Norwalk resident in need. Details below. 

1. Send me a DM on IG or Facebook by 5:00 pm Friday of this week on why you need the gift card.

2. Selected winner must be a resident of Norwalk. (I’m gonna check!)

3. I will meet you at Lowe’s this weekend to present the gift card to the winner. 

4. If you want to use it the same day I’ll save you 10% with my military discount. 

5. I don’t do the light show for anything other than the enjoyment of our community. And an occasional yard sign. 😏
