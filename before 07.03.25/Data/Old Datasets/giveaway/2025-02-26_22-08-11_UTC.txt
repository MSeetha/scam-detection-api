It's a busy work week for me.  How are you?

Tomorrow evening I will draw the winner for February's winter tulip bunch giveaway.  Yay!  The only thing you need to do is be signed up for my email newsletter.  You can sign up on my website at www.stone-oak-farm.com 

I am crossing my fingers for you!

(And yes, a bird's eye amaryllis photo to announce the tulip giveaway! ðŸ˜œ)
