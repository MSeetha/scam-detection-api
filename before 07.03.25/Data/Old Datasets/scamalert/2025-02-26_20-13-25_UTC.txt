Warning: Deepfake Video Calls on the Rise!

As we increasingly rely on video conferencing for personal and professional communication, a disturbing trend is emerging: deepfake video calls.

Scammers are using AI-powered deepfake technology to impersonate relatives, friends, or colleagues, convincing victims to transfer money or share sensitive information.

How it works:

1. Scammers gather personal info and photos from social media or other online sources.

2. They use deepfake software to create a convincing video of the impersonated person.

3. The scammer initiates a video call, pretending to be the relative or friend in distress.

4. The victim, convinced of the authenticity of the call, transfers money or shares sensitive info.

Protect yourself:

Verify the identity of the caller through other means, such as a phone call or text message.

Be cautious of urgent or emotional requests for money or information.

Report suspicious activity to the authorities and the video conferencing platform.

Let's raise awareness and stay vigilant!
