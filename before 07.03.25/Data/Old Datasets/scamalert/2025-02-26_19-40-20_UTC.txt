You can still submit reports with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) if you're a victim of fraud or think you might be targeted. We have links and instructions at www.lacsn.org/fraud for those agencies, as well as for @nvattorneygeneral and @bbbsouthnv.
