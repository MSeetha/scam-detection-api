🚨 **Attention Service Members** 🚨 

⚠️ There has been an attempt to scam GTCC cardholders out of their personal identifiable information (PII). Please be vigilant and aware of suspicious emails. 📧 

**Example of a scam email:** 
"Dear Cardholder, GTCC NOTIFICATION Number: 8157102580083456-758 This email serves as a final notice regarding your outstanding balance on your Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC) account. Our records indicate that you have an unpaid balance of $257.98 that is now 90 days past due..." 

🔒 **How to Identify Phishing and Social Engineering Scams:** 
1. **Check the Sender:** Legitimate emails will come from official domains, like @citicorp.com. 
2. **Look for Typos and Errors:** Scammers often use poor grammar and spelling. 
3. **Never Provide Personal Information:** Real organizations will not ask for your PII via email. 
4. **Avoid Clicking Unknown Links:** Hover over links to see their true destination before clicking. 

🚫 **Remember:** - You will not receive emails from CITI or HQDA Finance about late payments. - The G-8/USPFO for MT sends out memorandums for record to your unit if you are late on paying your GTCC. - If you receive a suspicious email, forward it to: `spoof@citicorp.com`. 

Stay safe and protect your information! 🛡️
