Have you heard of the Grandparent Scam? Despite the name, it is a deceitful con that preys on people of any age by pretending to be a child or a legal representative who desperately needs money for bail, legal fees, or medical expenses.
 
Proceed with caution if you receive a call claiming a family member needs money urgently. You can protect yourself in the following ways:
 
 • Verify the Caller: After hanging up, contact the family member on a known number.
 • Avoid Rash Decisions: Scammers use urgency as their weapon — don't let fear override your logic.
 • Beware of Late-Night Calls: It can be a red flag as scammers try to disorient you, expecting you to be less resistant.
 • Ask Questions: To confirm the caller's identity, ask questions that a stranger wouldn't know.
 • Confide in Someone Else: Don't send money or keep it a secret - always talk with another family member.
 
Report the scam to local law enforcement if you've encountered it.
