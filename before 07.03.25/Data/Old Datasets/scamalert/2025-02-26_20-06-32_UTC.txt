🚨 SCAM ALERT: Federal Jury Subpoena Calls 🚨

The Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Office, along with other law enforcement agencies, is warning residents about a recent phone scam. Scammers are impersonating sheriff’s deputies—specifically using the name Sergeant John Collins—and falsely claiming you’ve missed federal jury duty or ignored a subpoena. They may threaten you with arrest unless you make an immediate payment.

⚠️ IMPORTANT REMINDERS:

📞 The Sheriff’s Office will NEVER call you to demand payment or threaten arrest over missed jury duty.
📬 Legitimate jury duty notifications come through official mail—not phone calls.
💳 Do NOT provide personal information or send payments via gift cards, wire transfers, or cryptocurrency.
If you receive a call like this:

🚫 Hang up immediately.
